** Content of this channel
*** Melpa
In ~(emacs packages melpa)~, you have a list of all packages from melpa (unstable).
These will be updated daily.

All packages that are unfetchable will not be included in the package list.
If this happens, you can always use ~guix import elpa -t melpa <package_name+>~.
