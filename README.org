* Emacs channel
** Quickstart

To use this channel, add to your ~.config/guix/channels.scm~:

#+begin_src scheme
(cons*
 (channel
  (name 'emacs)
  (url "https://github.com/babariviere/guix-emacs")
  (introduction
   (make-channel-introduction
    "72ca4ef5b572fea10a4589c37264fa35d4564783"
    (openpgp-fingerprint
     "261C A284 3452 FB01 F6DF  6CF4 F9B7 864F 2AB4 6F18"))))
 ;; other channels here...
 )
#+end_src

Then run ~guix pull~ to be able to install packages.

** Content of this channel
*** Melpa
In ~(emacs packages melpa)~, you have a list of all packages from melpa (unstable).
These will be updated daily.

All packages that are unfetchable will not be included in the package list.
If this happens, you can always use ~guix import elpa -t melpa <package_name+>~.

** Override package
In emacs/packages/melpa.scm, define a new package:

#+begin_src scheme
(define-module (emacs packages melpa)
  #:replace (
			   emacs-my-package ; don't forget to re-export it
			   ))


(define-public emacs-my-package
  (inherit g/emacs-my-package) ; inherit from generated package
  ;; add your new fields here
  )
#+end_src

To build your package, you can run:

#+begin_src sh
guix build -L . '(@@ (emacs packages melpa) emacs-my-package)'
#+end_src

TODO: find a way to not build from melpa-generated by default.

NOTE: you will have to replace your packages with the new override!

** What can be improved
*** Allow to import only one package

*** Support Emacs native compilation
